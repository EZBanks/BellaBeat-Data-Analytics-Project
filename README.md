## Executive Summary

The aim of this analysis is to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights discovered will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. 
This report covers different phases in my analysis to help answer the business questions raised by the management. These phases include Ask questions, Prepare data, Process data, Analyze data, Share data, and Act.

## Methodology

Before performing the analysis, the data was collected through a public domain, then wrangled to make sure it’s cleaned, reliable and error-free by removing duplicates, finding and filling missing values and normalizing data. After that, I explored and found correlation between variables, proceeded to data visualization to better capture trends and insights and finally made highly recommendations to the executive team.
